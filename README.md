# photosorter
A program for easily organizing and sorting photographs

The program in the proof of concept folder was written in about three hours to assist me in selecting photos for editing. The file directories are hardcoded in, instead of moving or copying the photos it simply saves the filenames to preconfigured lists, and the interface is very ugly. 

Upcoming features:
* Selection of source and destination directories
* Options to move or copy photos
* Potentially expand to other filetypes (will result in project being forked)
